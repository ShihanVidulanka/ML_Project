Feature Selection and Engineering for AudioMNIST Speaker Labels In
this project, we processed AudioMNIST data with 256 features and 4
target labels. Through techniques like feature selection, engineering, and
dimensionality reduction, we enhanced predictive models for Speaker
ID, Age, Gender, and Accent. Evaluation will be done on test data using
metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.
